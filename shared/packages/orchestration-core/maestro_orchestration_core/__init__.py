MAESTRO Orchestration Module

Integrates Schema v3.0 personas with autonomous SDLC engine and team workflows.

NOTE: The main workflow API now uses AutonomousSDLCEngineV3_1_Resumable from
/home/ec2-user/projects/shared/claude_team_sdk/examples/sdlc_team/team_execution.py
which includes V3.1 persona-level intelligent reuse capabilities.

This module's AutonomousSDLCEngineV3Resumable is maintained for backward
compatibility with existing test scripts and examples.
