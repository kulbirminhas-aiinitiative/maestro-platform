JIRA EPIC ANALYSIS & CONSOLIDATION REPORT
=========================================
Date: 2025-12-07
Context: Alignment with "New Vision" (Conductor Integration, Evolutionary Templates, Quality Fabric)

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
The current JIRA backlog contains several Epics that overlap with the new "Platform-First" architecture we have established. 
**Key Finding**: `MD-2382` (Quality & Templates) and `MD-2501` (Gap-Driven Iteration) are the strategic pivots. We should consolidate scattered tasks into these to reflect the "Conductor Integration".

2. STRATEGIC MERGES & RESTRUCTURING
-----------------------------------

A. THE "QUALITY FABRIC & TEMPLATES" CLUSTER (The New Vision)
------------------------------------------------------------
**Primary Epic**: `MD-2382` "SDLC Quality Gateway Enforcement & Template Standardization"
**Action**: **RENAME & REPURPOSE**
**New Name**: `[PLATFORM] Quality Fabric & Evolutionary Templates (Conductor Integration)`
**Rationale**: This Epic perfectly describes the work we just defined (Quality Fabric Config + Atomic Templates).
**Consolidation**:
- **Merge** `MD-2384` "Agent-Level Error Tracking & Recursive Learning Loop" -> This is the "Evolution Engine" (Template Learning).
- **Merge** `MD-2441` "Compliance Gaps" -> Compliance is now part of the "Quality Fabric" (Security Tests).
- **Child Tickets**: Assign all newly created tickets (MD-2700 to MD-2727) to this Epic.

B. THE "SELF-REFLECTION" CLUSTER
--------------------------------
**Primary Epic**: `MD-2501` "[MAESTRO] Sub-EPIC 8: Gap-Driven Iteration"
**Action**: **KEEP & OPERATIONALIZE**
**Rationale**: This Epic tracks the *mechanism* of self-improvement. The `gap_to_jira.py` tool is the implementation of this Epic.
**Status**: Move to "In Progress". The tool is built and running.

C. THE "CORE SDLC" CLUSTER
--------------------------
**Primary Epic**: `MD-2481` "[PLATFORM] Maestro SDLC Workflow Engine"
**Action**: **KEEP**
**Rationale**: This remains the parent for the Orchestrator logic (`dag_api_server`, `workflow_engine`).
**Sub-Epics**:
- `MD-2482` (Phase 1 Validation): Keep. Map to Conductor Phase 1/2.
- `MD-2483` (Phase 2 Hardening): Keep. Map to Conductor Phase 3/4 (Security/Ops).

3. DETAILED DISPOSITION TABLE
-----------------------------

| Key | Current Summary | Recommendation | Rationale |
|-----|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **MD-2382** | SDLC Quality Gateway... | **RENAME** to `[PLATFORM] Quality Fabric...` | **The Main Container** for recent work. |
| **MD-2384** | Recursive Learning Loop | **MERGE** into `MD-2382` | This is the "Evolution Engine" feature. |
| **MD-2441** | Compliance Gaps | **MERGE** into `MD-2382` | Compliance is a Quality Gate. |
| **MD-2501** | Gap-Driven Iteration | **KEEP** | Tracks the `gap_to_jira` tool itself. |
| **MD-2541** | AI Persona Foundry | **KEEP** | Distinct capability (Team Management). |
| **MD-2533** | Auto-Refactoring | **KEEP** | Distinct capability (Self-Healing). |
| **MD-2529** | Blueprint Scoring | **KEEP** | Specific algorithm fix. |
| **MD-2502** | CLI Slash Command | **KEEP** | Specific UI feature. |
| **MD-2492** | Test EPIC Me | **DELETE** | Test artifact. |
| **MD-2483** | Production Hardening | **KEEP** | Align with Conductor Phase 4. |
| **MD-2482** | Core Validation | **KEEP** | Align with Conductor Phase 2. |
| **MD-2481** | SDLC Workflow Engine | **KEEP** | Core Orchestration container. |
| **MD-2385** | Team Performance | **KEEP** | Distinct capability. |
| **MD-2383** | Tri-Modal Validation | **KEEP** | Specific architectural pattern. |
| **MD-2378** | Integration Bridge | **REVIEW** | Check if superseded by Conductor. |
| **MD-2240** | Technical Debt | **KEEP** | General bucket. |
| **MD-1790** | Deployment GUI | **KEEP** | UI capability. |

4. ACTION PLAN
--------------
1.  **Rename** `MD-2382` to `[PLATFORM] Quality Fabric & Evolutionary Templates (Conductor Integration)`.
2.  **Link** the 28 new tickets (MD-2700 series) to `MD-2382`.
3.  **Close** `MD-2384` and `MD-2441` as "Duplicate/Merged" pointing to `MD-2382`.
4.  **Delete** `MD-2492`.
