MD-2385 Validation Report
=========================

EPIC: MD-2385 - Real-Time Team Performance Metrics & Grading System
Status: Done (in JIRA)
Actual Status: **Incomplete / Fake Done**

Summary
-------
The Epic is marked as "Done", but the implementation is incomplete and relies on mock data. All remediation child tasks (MD-2468 to MD-2474) are in "To Do" status.

Detailed Findings
-----------------

### 1. Frontend Implementation
| File | Status | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `maestro-frontend/src/components/PerformanceMetrics.tsx` | ⚠️ **Mocked** | Contains comment: `// Mock data - replace with actual API calls` |

### 2. Backend Implementation
| Component | Expected File | Status | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Team Aggregation | `src/maestro_hive/teams/performance_tracker.py` | ❌ **Missing** | File does not exist. |
| Agent Tracker | `dde/performance_tracker.py` | ✅ **Exists** | Exists but lacks team-level aggregation logic. |
| Gamification | `*gamification*` | ❌ **Missing** | No gamification logic found. |

### 3. Child Tasks (Remediation)
| Task | Summary | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| MD-2468 | Add formal acceptance criteria | To Do |
| MD-2469 | Technical design document | To Do |
| MD-2470 | Replace frontend mock data | To Do |
| MD-2471 | Team performance aggregation service | To Do |
| MD-2472 | Connect Jira/Git tools | To Do |
| MD-2473 | Gamification features | To Do |
| MD-2474 | Test suite | To Do |

### 4. Conclusion
The "Done" status is incorrect. The feature is partially implemented (UI shell exists) but non-functional (mock data) and missing core backend logic.

Recommendation
--------------
1.  **Reopen MD-2385 (EPIC)**.
2.  **Keep Child Tasks Open**.
3.  **Schedule Implementation**.
