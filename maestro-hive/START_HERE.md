## 🎯 The Key Discovery

### What We Found

**team_execution.py** (1,668 lines) is the **production working pipeline**:

```python
# This file contains EVERYTHING:
class AutonomousSDLCEngineV3_1_Resumable:
    - Persona execution (Claude Code SDK)
    - V4.1 persona-level reuse (PersonaReuseClient)
    - Quality gates (validation + reports)
    - Session management (load/save/resume)
    - File tracking (filesystem snapshots)
    - Deliverable mapping (pattern matching)
    - Validation reports (JSON + Markdown)
    - CLI interface (full featured)
```

### What This Means

**BEFORE**: Thought we needed to build V4.1 and integrate components  
**AFTER**: It's already built and integrated in team_execution.py  
**IMPACT**: 5x faster deployment (1 week vs 5 weeks)
