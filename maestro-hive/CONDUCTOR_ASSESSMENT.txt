CONDUCTOR PROJECT ASSESSMENT
============================
Date: 2025-12-07
Target: ~/projects/conductor (Maestro ML Platform)
Goal: Leverage for Templates (Evolution) and Quality (TaaS)

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
The `conductor` project is a mature, production-ready MLOps platform (Phase 4/4 complete). It contains critical infrastructure that directly addresses the "Gaps" in `maestro-hive`.

2. LEVERAGE FOR TEMPLATES (Evolutionary Learning)
-------------------------------------------------
The "Evolutionary Learning" requirement for templates needs:
- Experiment Tracking (Inputs vs. Outputs)
- A/B Testing (Template V1 vs. V2)
- Model Training (Learning from feedback)

**Conductor Assets:**
- `ab_testing/`: A complete Python module with engines, models, and routing.
  - *Usage*: We can use this to serve different template versions to different projects and measure "rewrite rate" as the success metric.
- `mlflow/`: Fully deployed Model Registry and Tracking Server.
  - *Usage*: Log every "Template Generation" event as a "Run". Log the "Diff Score" as a metric.
- `training/`: Distributed training operator.
  - *Usage*: Fine-tune LLMs on the "high-quality" user edits to improve base templates.

3. LEVERAGE FOR QUALITY (Quality Assurance)
-------------------------------------------
The "Quality" subsystem needs a "Quality Fabric" to define and enforce standards.

**Conductor Assets:**
- `quality-fabric-config.yaml`: A comprehensive configuration file defining:
  - Test Types (Unit, Integration, Contract, Security, Performance).
  - Quality Gates (Coverage %, Pass Rate %).
  - Execution Environment (Docker Compose).
  - *Usage*: This is the "Missing Link" for `maestro-hive`. We should adopt this schema immediately.
- `tests/`: Extensive test suite examples including "Blueprint Tests" and "Contract Tests".
- `security/`: Vault integration and compliance checks.

4. RECOMMENDATION
-----------------
1. **Adopt Schema**: Copy `quality-fabric-config.yaml` to `maestro-hive` as the definition of the Quality Subsystem.
2. **Import Logic**: Port the `ab_testing` module to `src/maestro_hive/blocks/templates/evolution/` to power the `EvolutionEngine`.
3. **Integration**: Do not rebuild ML infrastructure. Configure `maestro-hive` to connect to the `conductor` MLflow and Airflow instances.

5. NEXT STEPS
-------------
1. Copy `quality-fabric-config.yaml` to `maestro-hive`.
2. Update `EvolutionEngine` to use `ab_testing` logic.
