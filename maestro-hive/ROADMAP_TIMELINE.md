# Maestro AI Platform - Strategic Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation (Now)
| Capability | Criticality | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Orchestration & Workflow** | HIGH | The nervous system of the platform - manages lifecycle, state, and execution. |
| **Team & Persona Management** | HIGH | The Manager layer - handles AI team composition and collaboration. |
| **User Interface** | MEDIUM | The Face layer - provides human interaction touchpoints. |
| **RAG Persona Integration** | HIGH | Integration of RAG workflows into the Persona creation and testing lifecycle. |
| **Team & Mission Execution Flow** | HIGH | End-to-end flow for creating teams and executing missions. |
| **Mission to Execution Handoff** | HIGH | Seamless transition from mission discussion to artifact publishing and workflow execution. |
| **Human-in-the-Loop Approval** | HIGH | Mechanisms for AI agents to request and wait for human approval before critical actions. |
| **Workflow Optimization & Standardization** | HIGH | The 'Proof in the Pudding' layer. Ensures execution excellence through standardized toolkits, shared libraries, enforced best practices, and RAG-driven error prevention. |
| **Resilient Execution & Observability Grid** | HIGH | Enterprise-grade execution environment ensuring fault tolerance, deep observability (tracing), and secure sandboxing for agent operations. |

## Phase 2: Intelligence (Next)
| Capability | Criticality | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Requirements Engineering** | MEDIUM | The Brain layer - ingests, analyzes, and decomposes requirements. |
| **Code Generation & Templates** | HIGH | The Worker layer - generates production-quality code. |
| **Quality Assurance** | HIGH | The Inspector layer - ensures code quality through testing and validation. |
| **Knowledge & Learning (RAG)** | HIGH | The Memory layer - learns from past executions and retrieves relevant context. |
| **Compliance & Governance** | MEDIUM | The Auditor layer - enforces policies and maintains audit trails. |
| **DevOps & Infrastructure** | MEDIUM | The Plumber layer - manages CI/CD, deployment, and infrastructure. |
| **External Project Gap Analysis** | HIGH | Ability to scan external repositories against a user-defined vision and generate JIRA tickets for gaps. |

## Phase 3: Autonomy (Future)
| Capability | Criticality | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Self-Reflection** | HIGH | The Conscience layer - analyzes own performance and proposes improvements. |
| **Persona Evolution & Learning** | HIGH | Enables AI Agents to learn from interactions, adapt their style, and evolve their personality over time based on human feedback and environmental context. |
| **Team Evolution & Optimization** | HIGH | Tracks team performance, benchmarks success rates, and recommends optimal team compositions based on historical data and evolving persona capabilities. |
| **Team Simulation & Benchmarking** | HIGH | Background simulation and mathematical modeling of team performance to identify optimal compositions for specific tasks. |
| **Persona Trait Evolution & Guidance** | HIGH | Granular tracking of persona traits, skill usage/decay, and guided evolution plans to shape agent personality over time. |
| **Persona Fusion & Hybridization** | MEDIUM | Ability to merge multiple personas to create a new hybrid agent that inherits and blends traits, skills, and memories from its parents. |
| **AI Skill Injection Marketplace** | MEDIUM | Mechanism to instantly 'install' new capabilities (knowledge, tools, prompts) into a Persona from a curated marketplace. |
| **Autonomous Team Retrospective & Evaluation** | HIGH | Post-mission analysis where an external Evaluator reviews team performance alongside agent self-reflection to codify process improvements. |
| **Shadow Learning & Action Replay** | HIGH | The 'Watch & Learn' layer. Observes human developer actions, correlates edits with outcomes, and learns to autonomously replay successful patterns. |
| **Strategic Autonomy & Goal Decomposition** | HIGH | The 'CEO' layer. Takes abstract business goals and autonomously decomposes them into technical roadmaps, epics, and executable JIRA tickets. |
