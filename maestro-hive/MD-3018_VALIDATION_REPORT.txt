MD-3018 Validation Report
=========================

EPIC: MD-3018 - Persona Trait Evolution & Guidance
Status: Done (in JIRA)
Actual Status: **Partially Complete / Fake Done**

Summary
-------
The Epic is marked as "Done", but the frontend component is missing. The backend implementation appears complete.
There are 4 child tasks (MD-2936 to MD-2939) which were auto-generated as "Missing File" tasks. 3 of these files actually exist now, but the tasks remain in "To Do".

Detailed Findings
-----------------

### 1. Backend Implementation (Found)
| Task | File | Status | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| MD-2936 | `src/maestro_hive/personas/trait_manager.py` | ✅ **Exists** | Implemented (637 lines). |
| MD-2937 | `src/maestro_hive/personas/skill_decay_tracker.py` | ✅ **Exists** | Implemented (528 lines). |
| MD-2938 | `src/maestro_hive/personas/evolution_guide.py` | ✅ **Exists** | Implemented (743 lines). |

### 2. Frontend Implementation (Missing)
| Task | File | Status | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| MD-2939 | `frontend/src/components/foundry/TraitEvolutionDashboard.tsx` | ❌ **Missing** | File does not exist. |

### 3. Conclusion
The backend work is done, but the frontend work is not. The Epic should not be "Done".
The child tasks MD-2936, MD-2937, MD-2938 should be closed as "Done".
MD-2939 should remain "To Do".

Recommendation
--------------
1.  **Reopen MD-3018 (EPIC)**.
2.  **Close MD-2936, MD-2937, MD-2938** (Mark as Done).
3.  **Keep MD-2939 Open**.
