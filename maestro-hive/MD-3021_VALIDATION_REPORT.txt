MD-3021 Validation Report
=========================

EPIC: MD-3021 - Persona Evolution & Learning
Status: Done (in JIRA)
Actual Status: **Partially Complete / Fake Done**

Summary
-------
The Epic is marked as "Done", but the frontend component is missing. The backend implementation is partially complete (core engines exist, but some helper modules listed in child tasks are missing).
All 4 child tasks (MD-2924 to MD-2927) are in "To Do".

Detailed Findings
-----------------

### 1. Backend Implementation
| File | Status | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `src/maestro_hive/personas/learning_engine.py` | ✅ **Exists** | Implemented (624 lines). |
| `src/maestro_hive/personas/evolution_tracker.py` | ✅ **Exists** | Implemented (791 lines). |
| `src/maestro_hive/personas/evolution_engine.py` | ❌ **Missing** | Required by MD-2924. |
| `src/maestro_hive/personas/memory_store.py` | ❌ **Missing** | Required by MD-2925. |
| `src/maestro_hive/personas/style_adapter.py` | ❌ **Missing** | Required by MD-2926. |

### 2. Frontend Implementation
| File | Status | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `frontend/src/components/foundry/PersonaGrowthDashboard.tsx` | ❌ **Missing** | Required by Epic. |
| `frontend/src/components/foundry/PersonaEvolutionStats.tsx` | ❌ **Missing** | Required by MD-2927. |

### 3. Conclusion
The Epic is not complete. While the core logic exists, the frontend and several supporting backend modules are missing.

Recommendation
--------------
1.  **Reopen MD-3021 (EPIC)**.
2.  **Keep Child Tasks Open**.
3.  **Schedule Implementation** for missing components.
