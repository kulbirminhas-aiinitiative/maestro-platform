MD-3021 Proof Analysis
======================

The proof file `phase3_implementation.json` claims the following files were created:

1.  `src/maestro_hive/personas/learning_engine.py` (550 lines) - **FOUND**
2.  `src/maestro_hive/personas/evolution_tracker.py` (580 lines) - **FOUND**
3.  `frontend/src/components/foundry/PersonaGrowthDashboard.tsx` (420 lines) - **MISSING**

Unlike MD-3033, there is no `implementation/` folder containing the missing frontend code. The `proof` folder only contains JSON metadata and one test file (`tests/test_evolution_learning.py`).

Conclusion
----------
The frontend code for MD-3021 is **NOT** in the documentation folder. It appears to be genuinely missing, despite the JSON claiming it was created. This reinforces the "Fake Done" verdict for the frontend component.
