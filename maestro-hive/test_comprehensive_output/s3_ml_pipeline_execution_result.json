  "requirement": "\nCreate a production ML pipeline for customer churn prediction:\n\n1. Data Ingestion (Python/Airflow):\n   - Ingest data from 3 sources: PostgreSQL, S3 CSV files, REST API\n   - Schedule: Daily at 2 AM UTC\n   - Data validation and quality checks\n   - Store raw data in data lake (S3)\n\n2. ETL Pipeline (Python/Pandas/PySpark):\n   - Clean and transform data\n   - Feature engineering:\n     * Customer lifetime value\n     * Engagement scores\n     * Usage patterns\n     * Transaction frequency\n   - Store features in feature store\n   - Data versioning with DVC\n\n3. ML Model Training (Python/Scikit-learn/MLflow):\n   - Train binary classification model (churn yes/no)\n   - Models to evaluate: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM\n   - Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna\n   - Track experiments in MLflow\n   - Model validation (AUC > 0.85)\n   - Model versioning and registry\n\n4. Model Serving (FastAPI):\n   - REST API for predictions\n   - Endpoints:\n     * POST /predict - Single prediction\n     * POST /batch-predict - Batch predictions\n     * GET /model/info - Model metadata\n   - Input validation with Pydantic\n   - Response time < 50ms p95\n\n5. Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana):\n   - Model performance metrics\n   - Prediction latency\n   - Data drift detection\n   - Alerting on degradation\n\n6. Infrastructure (Terraform/Kubernetes):\n   - Deploy to Kubernetes\n   - Auto-scaling (2-10 pods)\n   - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions\n   - Blue-green deployment\n\n7. Testing:\n   - Unit tests for data processing\n   - Model accuracy tests\n   - API integration tests\n   - Load testing (1000 requests/sec)\n\n8. Documentation:\n   - Architecture diagram\n   - Data dictionary\n   - Model card (fairness, bias, limitations)\n   - API documentation\n   - Runbook for operations\n\nTimeline: 4 weeks\nTeam size: 5-6 specialists\nQuality: Production-grade with monitoring\n",
