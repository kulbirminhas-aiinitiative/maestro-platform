## Critical Gaps Analysis

### 🔴 RELEASE BLOCKERS:

#### 1. Frontend Core Pages (CRITICAL)
```typescript
// Current state - BLOCKING RELEASE
// File: frontend/src/pages/BoardPage.tsx
return (
  <Card>
    <CardTitle>Coming Soon</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>
      Board management interface is under development
    </CardDescription>
  </Card>
);
```

**Impact:** Users cannot use primary application features
**Effort Required:** 5-8 days of development
**Priority:** P0 - Must fix before any release

#### 2. Test Environment Setup (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Current Issues:
- No node_modules installed
- Database not configured for testing
- Redis service not running
- Environment variables missing
```

**Impact:** Cannot validate quality or catch regressions
**Effort Required:** 1-2 days of DevOps setup
**Priority:** P0 - Must fix for quality assurance

#### 3. Real-time Feature Integration (HIGH)
- Backend WebSocket service: ✅ Implemented
- Frontend WebSocket client: ⚠️ Stubbed
- UI real-time indicators: ❌ Missing

**Impact:** Key competitive feature non-functional
**Effort Required:** 3-4 days of frontend integration
**Priority:** P1 - Important for user experience
