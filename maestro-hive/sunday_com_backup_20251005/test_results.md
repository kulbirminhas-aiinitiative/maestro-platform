## Quality Gate Assessment

### Test Quality Gates:
- ✅ Test framework properly configured
- ✅ Comprehensive test cases written
- ⚠️ Tests not executable due to environment
- ⚠️ Coverage cannot be validated
- ❌ CI/CD integration not active

### Overall Test Readiness: 🟡 PREPARED BUT NOT VALIDATED

**Summary:** The test infrastructure is excellently designed and implemented, but cannot be validated without proper environment setup. The test code quality is high and coverage appears comprehensive based on code analysis.
