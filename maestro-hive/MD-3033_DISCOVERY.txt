MD-3033 Investigation Update
==========================

Discovery
---------
The "missing" files for MD-3033 were found in a detached documentation folder:
`/home/ec2-user/projects/docs/jira/MD-3033/implementation/`

This explains why the Compliance Report gave it a 100% score (it likely scanned this folder), while the actual codebase was empty (Fake Done).

Files Found (Staged but not Deployed):
- `e2e/fixtures/auth.fixture.ts`
- `e2e/fixtures/database.fixture.ts`
- `e2e/fixtures/api.fixture.ts`
- `docker-compose.e2e.yml`
- `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`
- `scripts/db-reset.sh`
- And more...

Resolution Plan
---------------
1.  **Move Files**: Copy these files from the `docs` folder to `maestro-frontend-production`.
2.  **Verify Integration**: Ensure they work in the new location.
3.  **Update JIRA**: Mark tasks as Done (legitimately this time).
