SDLC Team Organization Structure

Defines how the 11 SDLC personas are organized into phases and how they collaborate
to deliver software solutions from requirements to deployment.

Organization Principles:
1. Phase-based structure: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment
2. Parallel workstreams: Documentation and Security run parallel to main phases
3. Clear handoffs: Each phase has defined entry/exit criteria
4. Continuous collaboration: Personas collaborate across phase boundaries
5. Feedback loops: Testing and security findings trigger earlier phases
