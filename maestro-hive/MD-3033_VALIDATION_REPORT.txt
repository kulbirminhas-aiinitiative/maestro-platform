MD-3033 Validation Report
=========================

EPIC: MD-3033 - E2E Testing Foundation Infrastructure
Status: Done (in JIRA)
Actual Status: **Incomplete / Fake Done**

Summary
-------
The Epic is marked as "Done", but critical infrastructure components are missing. All child tasks (MD-3043 to MD-3048) are in "To Do".

Detailed Findings
-----------------

### 1. Missing Files
| Task | Required File | Status | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| MD-3043 | `frontend/e2e/fixtures/auth.fixture.ts` | ❌ **Missing** | Only `accessibility` and `consoleCapture` exist. |
| MD-3043 | `frontend/e2e/fixtures/database.fixture.ts` | ❌ **Missing** | |
| MD-3043 | `frontend/e2e/fixtures/api.fixture.ts` | ❌ **Missing** | |
| MD-3046 | `docker-compose.e2e.yml` | ❌ **Missing** | |
| MD-3046 | `enhanced_playwright_adapter.py` | ❌ **Missing** | Not found in workspace. |

### 2. Existing Components
| Component | File | Status | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CI/CD | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | ✅ **Exists** | Contains `frontend-e2e-tests` job and Playwright config. |

### 3. Child Tasks
All 6 child tasks are in "To Do" status, despite the Epic being "Done".

### 4. Conclusion
The Epic is not complete. While CI configuration exists, the test infrastructure (fixtures, docker environment, adapter) is missing.

Recommendation
--------------
1.  **Reopen MD-3033 (EPIC)**.
2.  **Keep Child Tasks Open**.
3.  **Update MD-3045 (CI/CD)** to reflect partial progress (or keep open until fully verified).
